									<h1>Who is<br />
									Tim Harrison-Reyes?</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/harrison2.PNG" alt="" /></span>I have been working in Special Education at the Secondary level for the past 13 years and this has awakened my desire to pursue data analysis. As a teacher, I am constantly collecting informal and formal data for Individual Education Plans (IEPS) and to better inform my instruction. At Madison Park Technical Vocational High School (2023 - present), I am a Resource Room Special Education Teacher that must use data tracking as a way to determine appropriate academic interventions and I continue my work as a Technology Coordinator. While at Brighton High School (2012-2023), I led the Occupational Skills and Development Center (OSDC) as a teacher leader and expanded the program's partnerships by 75% and improved vocational opportunities by 50%. Another great part of my current position is that I am one of two Technology Coordinators (TC) within the building.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Harrison3.jpg" alt="" /></span>Being a TC is not only about IT support, it is about analyzing and addressing the problems of the school. At Madison Park, the priority was to reduce Chromebook loss. My initial analysis showed a 57% loss rate. To reduce the current loss rate, we have implemented tracking and accountability measures using Google Sheets and automations through Google App Scripts. We have seen a reduction of the current loss rate from 57% to 32% and a 100% loaner return rate from November to present day. Another major issue kept rising: balancing being a teacher and a Technology Coordinator. To better do this, I created the Student Technology Team internship program, which teaches students leadership, computer troubleshooting, and customer service skills. </p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/harrison4.jpg" alt="" /></span>The more skills I developed through necessity (learning App Scripts, automation, and spreadsheet functions, etc.), I realized that I had developed a passion for developing multi-faceted solutions to large scale problems. I have always had a passion for problem solving and it initially pushed me to into Historical analysis as an Undergraduate. In 2020, I chose to get a Masters of Science in Data Analytics because it combined two of my favorite things: solving problems and technology.</p>
