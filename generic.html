									<h1>Who is<br />
									Tim Harrison-Reyes?</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/harrison2.PNG" alt="" /></span>I have been working in Special Education at the Secondary level for the past 12 years and this has awakened my desire to pursue data analysis. As a teacher, I am constantly collecting informal and formal data for Individual Education Plans (IEPS) or to better inform my instruction. Over the past three years, I have led the Occupational Skills and Development Center (OSDC) as a teacher leader and have expanded the program's partnerships by 75% and improved vocational oppurtunities by 50%. Another great part of my current position is that I am one of two Technology Coordinators (TC) within the building.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Harrison3.jpg" alt="" /></span>Being a TC is not only about IT support, it is about improving our customer service through feedback analysis. As part of this analysis, one major issue kept rising: balancing being a teacher and a Technology Coordinator. To better do this, I created the Student Technology Team internship program, which teaches students leadership, computer troubleshooting, and customer service skills. </p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/harrison4.jpg" alt="" /></span>Out of the internship program blossomed the need for Computer Science within the school. I worked with many industry-specific partners throughout Boston and local colleges to create the Computer Science pathway at Brighton. As part of this pathway, I teach Mobile App Development and Introduction to Computer Science. While I will always have a passion for education, it is time for me to explore more possibilities. I chose Data Analytics because it combined two of my favorite things: solving problems and programming.</p>
